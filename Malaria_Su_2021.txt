Abstract
Malaria is a deadly disease that affects the health of hundreds of millions of people annually. There are five Plasmodium parasite species that can naturally infect humans, including Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium knowlesi. Some of the parasites can also infect various non-human primates. Parasites mainly infecting monkeys such as Plasmodium cynomolgi (in fact P. knowlesi was considered as a parasite of monkeys for years) can also be transmitted to human hosts. Recently, many new Plasmodium species were discovered in African apes, and it is possible that some
of the parasites can be transmitted to humans in the future. Here, we searched PubMed and
the internet via Google and selected articles concerning zoonotic transmission and evolution
of selected malaria parasite species. We reviewed the current advances in the relevant topics emphasizing on transmissions of malaria parasites between humans and non-human primates. We also briefly discuss the transmissions of some avian malaria parasites between wild birds and domestic fowls. Zoonotic malaria transmissions are widespread, which poses a threat to public health. More studies on parasite species identification in non-human primates, transmission, and evolution are needed to reduce or prevent transmission of malaria parasites from non-human primates to humans.

INTRODUCTION: MALARIA PARASITES AND LIFE CYCLE
Malaria is still a serious public health burden worldwide, with approximately 229 million clinical cases and 368,000 deaths reported in 87 malaria endemic countries in 2019
[1]. There are nearly 300 characterized Plasmodium species infecting mammals, rodents, birds, lizards, bats, and ungulates, including at least 29 species that can infect non-human primates [2–4] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Plasmodium_species). Human malaria is caused by five Plasmodium species, including Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium ovale, and Plasmodium knowlesi. P. falciparum
is the deadliest parasite, whereas P. vivax is the most widespread species. Malaria parasites infecting a group of related vertebrate species generally have relatively strict host specificity. Plasmodium berghei, Plasmodium chabaudi, and Plasmodium yoelii initially isolated from African thicket rats only infect rodent hosts such as mice and rats, and Plasmodium gallinaceum and Plasmodium relictum infect avian hosts [5, 6]. The rodent or avian parasites do not infect humans and are not a threat to public health. However, they may have economic impacts; avian parasites infecting wild birds may also be transmitted to domestic fowls and kill the hosts kept in the zoos or raised for foods [7, 8].
Many Plasmodium species can be transmitted between humans and non-human primates. For examples, human infections of New World monkey parasites Plasmodium simium and Plasmodium brasilianum are widely reported [9]. P. simium is closely related to P. vivax, and P. brasilianum is almost identical to P. malariae, suggesting transmission between humans and New World monkeys of these parasites. Recently, many potential new Plasmodium species were discovered in African apes [10–15]. Whether or not these parasites can infect humans currently or in the future remain to be determined. Human activities expanding deeper into jungles combined with the continuing evolution of Plasmodium parasites increases the likelihood of jumps of non-human primate parasites to humans. The threats of humans or domestic animals becoming infected by parasites in wild animals still exist, and additional investigations on parasite evolution, adaptation, and prevention of cross-species transmission are needed.
Malaria parasites have a complex life cycle involving two hosts: female mosquitoes (Anopheles for most malaria parasites) and humans or other vertebrates as secondary hosts (Figure 1). The life cycle starts with a bite of an infected mosquito that injects sporozoites into the skin of a vertebrate host. The sporozoites migrate within blood vesicles to the liver and infect hepatocytes [16, 17]. A parasite can replicate into thousands of merozoites inside a hepatocyte, and mature merozoites are released into the bloodstream to invade erythrocytes after rupture of the infected hepatocyte. Within a red blood cell (RBC), a merozoite replicates again and develops from ring, to trophozoite, and to schizont stages. The rapture of RBCs containing schizonts also release metabolic by-products including hemozoin (hz) from parasite digestion of hemoglobin. The parasite materials can trigger the host’s immune responses and cause various clinical symptoms such as fever, chills, myalgia, headache, dizziness, and back pain [18]. For some patients, the infection may progress to severe malaria with coma (cerebral malaria), pulmonary edema, acidosis, hypoglycemia, acute renal failure, jaundice, severe anemia, and death [19–21]. Host responses such as the releases of metabolites and immune effectors may also trigger some parasites to differentiate into male and female gametocytes [22, 23]. When another mosquito takes a bloodmeal from an infected host, the gametocytes differentiate into male and female gametes that fertilize to form zygotes in the midgut. The zygotes then develop into motile ookinetes that penetrate mosquito midgut wall to develop into oocysts. A mature oocyst contains thousands of sporozoites that migrate to salivary glands. When the mosquito bites a vertebrate host, sporozoites are injected into the skin, staring a life cycle. All Plasmodium species have similar life cycle with different species of mosquito and vertebrate hosts, although the length of life cycles can be different. For example, the erythrocytic cycle is approximately 24 h for P. knowlesi, 48 h for P. falciparum, P. vivax, and P. ovale, and 72 h for P. malariae [19, 24–27].
For this brief review, we searched PubMed and Google for selected parasite species
(P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale, P. knowlesi, P. cynomolgi, P. simium, P. brasilianum, and others), combined with phrases such as ‘zoonotic transmission’, ‘molecular evolution’, ‘host switch’, and ‘monkey or non-human primate malaria’. Selected relevant references cited in published articles were also reviewed and discussed. In the following section, we will briefly describe the origins and zoonotic transmissions of some important malaria parasites that infect humans and non-human primates as summarized in Figure 2. Examples of avian malaria parasite causing damages to birds in the zoos and domestic fowls are also discussed briefly.

THE ORIGIN OF P. FALCIPARUM AND TRANSMISSIONS BETWEEN HUMANS AND APES
With the development of DNA sequencing and genotyping tools, there has been a great interest in the origins and evolution histories of malaria parasites, with ongoing debates
on the origins and time to the common ancestors of P. falciparum and P. vivax [28,
29]. Analysis of small-subunit ribosomal RNA genes initially suggested that P. falciparum and avian parasites shared a relatively recent progenitor [30]. The chimpanzee parasite Plasmodium reichenowi has also been considered the closest species to P. falciparum for years because both parasites have high-AT content genome and share high degree of genome similarity [31]. One long-standing hypothesis is that P. falciparum and P. reichenowi evolved from a P. falciparum-like common ancestor, and that they co-evolved with their respective hosts for millions of years [32]. Recent discoveries of a multitude of Plasmodium spp. in chimpanzees and gorillas suggest that P. falciparum likely resulted from a recent cross species transmission of parasites from African apes [14, 15, 29, 33, 34]. In one study, DNA sequences in nearly 3000 fecal samples collected from wild-living apes (chimpanzees and gorillas) were amplified and sequenced [14]. Analysis of more than 1,100 mitochondrial, apicoplast, and nuclear gene sequences from the animals grouped most of the sequences within one of six chimpanzee- or gorilla specific lineages representing distinct Plasmodium species, including three that had not previously been reported. There were also nine sequences related to another group of human parasites with higher GC content (P. malariae, P. ovale or P. vivax). These studies indicated the presence of many Plasmdoium species belonging to the Laverania subgenus in the apes: P. gaboni, P. billcollinsi, and P reichenowi in chimpanzees; and P. praefalciparum, P. blackloci, and P. adleri in gorillas [14, 35]. Additionally, Plasmodium lomamiensis was later identified in bonobos [15]. P. falciparum is also a member of the Laverania group and is the only parasite that has successfully adapted to humans after a potential transfer from gorillas to humans [14, 35]. P. falciparum has been proposed to arise from a single transfer of P. praefalciparum into humans [36]. Indeed, P. falciparum was found to be closely related to P. praefalciparum with an estimated divergence time of 40,000–60,000 years, and there were signals indicating significant gene flow between these two parasite species after their initial divergence [35]. The jumps of parasites from Africa apes to humans were likely due to adaption and mutations in a limited number of parasite genes involved in invasion of RBCs and host-parasite interaction [35, 37]. Parasites infecting the different primate hosts appear to have various genes involved in either invasion or pathogenesis fixed in their genomes [35]. For example, interaction of P. falciparum ligand EBA-175 to its erythrocyte sialoglycoprotein receptor, glycophorin A (GPA), plays a role in parasite invasion of RBCs [38]. Ape GPA sialic acid residues contain predominantly N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), whereas those of human have N-aceytlneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). The difference in Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc determines the receptor-ligand specificity: P. falciparum EBA-175 is unable to bind to chimpanzee GPA, whereas the P. reichenowi homolog of EBA-175 cannot bind to human GPA [39].
Although P. falciparum is known to only infection humans naturally, several splenectomized non-human primates have been shown to support P. falciparum growth and have been explored as animal models for studies of vaccine development and genetic crosses. Aotus infulatus (Owl) monkeys, both intact and splenectomized, could be infected with P. falciparum [40, 41]. The animals with intact spleen had low parasitemias, but developed severe complications like severe anemia, whereas the splenectomized monkeys had higher parasitemias without major complications. Similarly, spleen-intact and splenectomized saimiri monkeys could also be infected with Indochina 1/CDC and Uganda Palo FUP strains of P. falciparum; however, the animals recovered without development of severe disease [42]. Additionally, P. falciparum strains can be adapted to grow in splenectomized chimpanzees that had been used as hosts for genetic crosses [43–45]. The parasites in the apes are changing and evolving, and it is possible that additional parasites could jump from African Apes to humans, leading to new human malaria parasite species in the future.

THE ORIGIN OF P. VIVAX AND TRANSMISSIONS BETWEEN HUMANS AND NON-HUMAN PRIMATES
P. vivax is another important human malaria parasite that is endemic in Asia, Oceania,
and Central/South America, but is rare in sub-Saharan Africa due to the absence of Duffy antigen on RBCs of African human populations [46]. The ongoing debate concerning the origin of P. vivax is interesting with data supporting both Asian and African origins. Several earlier studies suggested that P. vivax might have arisen from the cross-species transmissions of parasites between humans and macaques in southeastern Asia [47–50]. However, the hypothesis of Asian origin was challenged recently following the characterization of many additional Plasmodium parasites from African apes [29]. Additional sequences from wild chimpanzees and gorillas throughout central Africa showed that these animals were endemically infected with parasites that are closely related to P. vivax, suggesting that P. vivax might have emerged in Africa [51]. Phylogenetic relationships derived from apicoplast genome sequences of several Asian primate parasites, Plasmodium cynomolgi, P. knowlesi, Plasmodium fragile, Plasmodium fieldi, Plasmodium simiovale, Plasmodium hylobati, Plasmodium inui, and P. gonderi also support African origin of P. vivax [52]. However, recent analyses of genomic variations of 447 human P. vivax strains and 19 ape P. vivax-like strains collected worldwide indicate that P. vivax may have derived from a single area in Asia through serial founder effects [53]. P. vivax was shown to be a sister group rather than a sublineage of P. vivax-like parasites, and a strong bottleneck in the lineage leading to P. vivax may explain richer genetic diversity in the P. vivax-like groups [53]. Amazingly, before these recent analyses of large numbers of parasite isolates and genomic datasets, Professor Richard Carter might have provided some answers to the debates on P. vivax origin based on changes in historical continental landmasses, climate, the distributions of primates over time, and malaria parasite selection on human genome (Duffy negative)in the Old World [54, 55]. He speculated that P. vivax could have diverged ~2 million years ago from a group of malaria parasites that are now endemic in monkeys and apes in southern Asia, and all P. vivax today might be descended from parasites that infected human populations in the Mediterranean region and in sub-Saharan Africa [55]. This hypothesis could explain the mixed signals found in parasite sequences collected from Asian and Africa. Nonetheless, although the debate on the origin of P. vivax is expected to continue, these studies clearly illustrate the zoonotic nature of P. falciparum and P. vivax parasites.

EMERGENCE OF P. VIVAX IN AFRICA AND INVASION OF DUFFY NEGATIVE RBCS
One of the pieces of evidence supporting an African origin of P. vivax is the lack Duffy antigen expression in African human populations and the requirement of Duffy antigen/ chemokine receptor (DARC) for parasite invasion of RBCs [46, 55]. The P. vivax parasite invades reticulocytes mainly through binding of P. vivax Duffy binding protein (PvDBP)
to DARC [56–58]. For many years Duffy-negative individuals were thought to be totally resistant to vivax malaria, which represents an example of selection of a genetic trait by
an infectious disease [59]. An amino acid substitution in a GATA-1 transcription factor binding site of the gene encoding the Duffy blood group, Fy, causes the absence of
DARC expression [60]. However, P. vivax has now been reported in Duffy-negative human populations [61–66]. Duplication of the PvDBP genes and low-level expression of the gene (undetectable previously) encoding DARC (Fy) could contribute to the observations of P. vivax in Duffy-negative individuals [67–71]. Additionally, African great apes may act as Duffy-positive reservoirs of P. vivax in regions where P. vivax parasites (or P. vivax–like parasites) were found in the blood of these great apes [72, 73]. These observations show that new infections may occur after mutations in both host and parasite genomes, leading to new transmissions. However, no significant difference in PvDBP copy number was also found in parasites infecting individuals with Duffy-null heterozygote and Duffy-positive homozygote/heterozygote [74]. The molecular mechanism of infecting Duffy-negative individuals requires further investigation.

P. VIVAX/P. SIMIUM IN HUMANS AND NEW WORLD MONKEYS
P. simium can infect Neotropical platyrrhine monkeys and humans. Although how P. simium specifically arrived in the Americas remains disputed, most of scientists studying the parasite agree that P. simium established in the New World monkeys after migrants brought the parasite (or P. vivax initially) from Europe and Africa during the colonial era or from Southeast Asia [75, 76]. P. vivax and P. simium have almost identical genomes, and parasites found in humans and simians can be transmitted by the same vectors in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil [77]. More recent phylogenetic analyses based on the whole genome sequences of P. simium isolates infecting humans and brown howler monkeys support the hypothesis that P. simium first infected non-human primates as a result of a host-switch from humans carrying P. vivax [78, 79]. Additionally, signals of multiple independent host switches were detected, suggesting zoonotic infections of humans, and non-human primate malaria parasites are reservoirs of potential human infectious [79]. Indeed, outbreak of human malaria caused by P. simium in the Atlantic Forest in Rio de Janeiro was reported [80]. Transmission from non-human primates to human must be considered in any attempt of malaria elimination in the region.

P. OVALE AND POTENTIAL ZOONOTIC TRANSMISSION
P. ovale is a human malaria parasite producing oval shape of infected erythrocytes [25, 81]. Similar to P. vivax, the parasite mostly invade reticulocytes to initiate the erythrocytic cycle and can suspend its development as hypnozoites in the liver for months, leading to relapses [25]. The parasite is mostly found in sub-Saharan Africa, the islands of the western Pacific such as the Philippines and New Guinea, as well as the Middle East, and southeast Asian countries [82–90]. Recently, two nonrecombining species of P. ovale, named P. ovale curtisi (classic type) and P. ovale wallikeri (variant type), were recognized [91, 92]. Phylogenetic analysis of Plasmodium genus based on genomic sequences placed P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri in a clade between those of P. vivax/P. cynomolgi and P. berghei/P. chabaudi [93]. The study also supports relatively ancient divergence of the two P. ovale species as evidenced by their different pir repertoires [93].
There are pieces of genetic evidence showing P. ovale parasites in African chimpanzees. In a study of partial mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb) and cytochrome c oxidase 1 (cox1) and nuclear ldh sequences from 130 samples collected from chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) in Cameroon, P. olave sequences were detected in two chimpanzees [90]. One chimpanzee was infected with parasites having sequences identical to the variant (wallikeri) P. ovale type, and the other infected with parasites different from the two
human P. ovale parasites. In a similar study, blood samples from 12 chimpanzees and two gorillas from Cameroon and one lemur from Madagascar were examined for two parasite mitochondrial genes (cytb and cox1), one plastid gene (tufA), and ldh, and P. ovale was found in the chimpanzees [94]. In another study, 16 wild West African chimpanzees in Taï National Park, Côte d’Ivoire were found to be naturally infected with P. ovale, P. vivax,
and P. malariae, and three types of plasmodia rarely observed in humans of the region [95]. These observations suggest potential natural cross-species exchange of P. ovale between humans and chimpanzees.

HUMAN INFECTION OF P. MALARIAE AND P. BRASILIANUM
The simian P. brasilianum causes quartan fever in New World monkeys and resembles the human quartan parasite P. malariae under the microscope. P. brasilianum parasites from monkeys can infect humans experimentally, and New World monkeys can be experimentally infected with P. malariae from humans [96–99]. The two parasites are almost genetically identical [9, 93, 100, 101]. Typically, when quartan malaria parasites were identified in monkeys, they were called P. brasilianum, and they were called P. malariae if detected in humans [101]. Analyses of parasite genes encoding the circumsporozoite protein (CSP)
and the small subunit of ribosomes (18S) from patients in remote Yanomami indigenous communities of Venezuela identified 12 individuals harboring parasites that were 100% identical with P. brasilianum isolated from the monkey, suggesting naturally acquired human infections of P. brasilianum [101]. Monkeys living in the rainforest therefore can act as natural reservoirs for P. brasilianum/P. malariae malaria [100]. Some studies showed that P. brasilianum strains seem to be more divergent than P. malariae parasite [9, 102], suggesting P. malariae might have derived from P. brasilianum. However, the levels of genetic variations were minimum, and the diversity could represent within species variations.
Genome sequence and phylogenetic analyses showed P. malariae and P. malariae-like make up a clade at the root of clades consisting of P. vivax/knowlesi/cynomolgi, P. ovale, and
P. berghei/chabaudi [93]. Additionally, cytb and ssrRNA sequences of P. malariae and
P. malariae-like were found in wild chimpanzees in tropical Africa [14, 95], suggesting potential transmission of P. malariae or P. malariae-like parasites from chimpanzees to humans.

OUTBREAKS OF P. KNOWLESI INFECTIONS IN HUMAN POPULATIONS
P. knowlesi is a malaria parasite initially found in long-tailed (Macaca fascicularis) and pig-tailed (Macaca nemestrina) macaques, and human infections were thought to be rare until natural infections in a large number of human individuals were reported in Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo, in 2004 [103, 104]. The parasite was first observed in blood film from a long-tailed macaque in the early 1930s [103]. Subsequently, blood passages of the parasite among its natural hosts, M. fascicularis, resulted in infection with low parasitemia [103]. Human natural infection was reported in a U.S. Army surveyor in Peninsular Malaysia more than 30 years later [105]. However, many human infections of P. knowlesi were likely misdiagnosed as being P. malariae by routine microscopy because the blood stages of P. knowlesi and P.malariae are very similar morphologically [106]. More extensive human infections of P. knowlesi were discovered in the past 15 years, particularly with
the development and applications of PCR-based techniques that have greatly improved the ability to detect P. knowlesi infection in humans and monkeys [104]. Following the report of a large focus of human infections of P. knowlesi in Malaysian Borneo in 2004 [107, 108], human cases of P. knowlesi infections have been reported the following countries: Malaysia [109–111]; Thailand [112–114]; Cambodia [115, 116]; Vietnam [117]; Myanmar [118];
the Philippines [119]; Singapore [120, 121]; and Indonesia [122]. Importantly, the areas with natural human P. knowlesi infections overlapped with the distribution of long-tailed and/or pig-tail macaques. Therefore, P. knowlesi is now recognized as the fifth species of human malaria species, and zoonotic transmission plays a key role in human infections.
The zoonotic transmission of P. knowlesi represents a challenge for malaria control and elimination in Southeast Asia [123]. Indeed, zoonotic P. knowlesi infection has become the major cause of malaria in Malaysia, especially Malaysian Borneo [124]. 

HUMAN INFECTIONS OF MONKEY MALARIA PARASITE P. CYNOMOLGI
P. cynomolgi is another malaria parasite that naturally infects Asian monkey species, including the long-tailed and pig-tailed macaques [125]; however, this parasite may also infect humans occasionally [126]. Human infection was reported when two staff members became infected with vivax-type parasites when they performed inoculations of monkeys with P. cynomolgi sporozoites [127]. Additional transmissions of P. cynomolgi from monkeys to man or from man to man were reported soon after [128–131]. Naturally acquired human infection of P. cynomolgi was reported in a symptomatic 39-year-old female nurse in peninsular Malaysia in 2014 [132]. In a more recent survey of malaria infections involving 14,732 individuals in 23 villages in Pailin and Battambang, western Cambodia, 1,361 people were asymptomatically infected with several species of malaria parasites, including 11 people infected with P. cynomolgi, eight infected with P. knowlesi, and two with both P. vivax and P. cynomolgi [116]. In Northern Sabah, Malaysia, two adult men were found to be infected with P. cynomolgi [110]. Additionally, six out of 1,047 blood samples collected at Kapit Hospital in Kapit, Malaysia, were found to be co-infected with
P. cynomolgi and P. knowlesi [111]. These reports suggest that P. cynomolgi can also infect humans naturally, although the prevalence of P. cynomolgi infection in humans may be lower than that of P. knowlesi. It is possible that more outbreaks of P. cynomolgi infection are not detected or can occur in the future if mutations in the key parasite genes involved in binding to host receptors occur in the parasites.

MALARIA SPECIES IN BIRDS AND TRANSMISSION BETWEEN CAPTIVE/ DOMESTIC AND WILD BIRDS
Avian hosts are infected with many species of malaria parasites such as P. relictum, Plasmodium elongatum, Plasmodium juxtanucleare, and P. gallinaceum [6, 133]. Although these parasites do not infect humans and are generally not a concern to public health, transmission of parasites from wild birds to domestic fowls can inflict economic losses
on the poultry industry. Transmissions of many avian malaria species are mediated by species of Culicidae mosquitoes belonging to different genera (Culex, Coquillettidia,
Aedes, Mansonia, Culisetta, Anopheles, Psorophora), instead of the Anopheles species for mammalian malaria parasites [134, 135]. There are many species of avian malaria parasites among wild birds, but studies on the disease severity and pathology on wild birds are limited [136, 137]. Traditionally, wild birds infected with these parasites are generally considered as having mild disease. However, avian malaria has been shown to play a
role in ongoing declines of native New Zealand birds [138]. Reduced overwinter survival
of both juvenile and adult house sparrows was associated with intensity of Plasmodium infections [139]. Various clinical signs were observed in domestic chickens following infection of P. gallinaceum, including depression, fever, anorexia, reduced weight gain, poor feed conversion, anemia, green feces, and even death [140]. Death of experimental passerine birds due to marked organ damages was reported after Plasmodium homocircumflexum infection [137]. Avian malaria, most commonly associated with P. relictum or P. elongatum, can also cause significant severe disease in penguins with mortality rates as high as 50%– 80% [141]. Vector and bird migration and vector introduction by human actions into non-endemic habitats represents a risk for endangered species [142]. For example, P. relictum was recently reported to expand its range, infecting two non-migratory passerines in North America [143]. Species of Plasmodium, Haemoproteus, and Leucocytozoon were reported to have infected cranes in Beijing Zoo, particularly the juvenile birds that often died from infection by Plasmodium and Leucocytozoon parasites [144]. Therefore, the transmission of avian malaria parasites between wild birds and domestic or captive avian hosts can be considered as examples of ‘zoonotic’ transmissions of malaria parasites.

CONCLUSION
Transmissions of malaria parasites from non-human primates to humans and vice versa occurred many times during the evolutionary histories of malaria parasites and their hosts. There are also parasites that have adapted to develop in both humans and non-human primates. All five malaria parasite species that infect humans have been found in non-human primates that in turn can act as reservoirs for transmission to humans. Additionally, malaria species currently infecting wild non-human primates may jump to humans if some parasites gain mutations that allow them to bind to receptors in humans. Furthermore, there are still many unknown species in wildlife hosts that need to be characterized. One approach is to collect fecal or tissue (blood) samples from potential hosts such as bats, wild rodents, and non-human primates, and extract DNA/RNA for high throughput sequencing to reveal parasite genetic information for species characterization.
The risk of malaria parasite outbreaks is always a threat to public health when human activities lead to close contact with non-human primates. Close surveillance and more studies on the biology and transmission of parasites circulating among non-human primates are of critical importance for preventing outbreaks of malaria due to zoonotic infections.
